lines is less than 0.0, it need not be plotted unless the metric being evaluated
takes on values that are less than 0.0.
Applying these steps to the data represented in Figure 4.8, we derive an individual
control chart as shown in Figure 4.10.
Zultner [ZUL99] reviews four criteria, called zone rules, that may be used to evaluate
whether the changes represented by the metrics indicate a process that is in
control or out of control. If any of the following conditions is true, the metrics data
indicate a process that is out of control:
1. A single metrics value lies outside the UNPL.
2. Two out of three successive metrics values lie more than two standard deviations
away from A m .
3. Four out of five successive metrics values lie more than one standard deviation
away from A m .
4. Eight consecutive metrics values lie on one side of A m .
